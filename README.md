# patientDataWebScraper
This application was a web scraper designed to extract patient information from a doctor or nurse's patient list on a website.

## Project Specifics:
This project is a generalized version of an application used to scrape information from a website and save it to a csv file. This is a personal project coded by myself for the purpose of assisting individuals who need to extract large amounts of information from websites and store them on a local file. The example used here is a doctor with a list of patients, but this code could be altered to fit almost any need. Primarily coded using puppeteer with node.js and javascript. The program is intended to be run once and done for each list of information.

## Installation:
- npm ci: Installs the necessary packages (namely puppeteer and objects-to-csv) 
- npm start: Runs the scraping script
